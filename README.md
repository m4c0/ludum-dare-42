This is a game about boxes. How you arrange and deliver them. Until you run out of space. Or sanity.

Due to time restrictions (my personal life's restrictions - not the 48/72 hours restriction), I can't make the full game I wanted to, but I kinda really liked the idea and I wanted to do at least a "proof of concept". This game is the result of that PoC.
